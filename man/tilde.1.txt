:summary: An intuitive terminal text editor

NAME
====

tilde - an intuitive text editor for the console/terminal

SYNOPSIS
========

tilde [_OPTIONS_] [_FILE_]...

DESCRIPTION
===========

Tilde is a text editor for the console/terminal, which tries to be as intuitive
as possible for users who are accustomed to GUI environments such as Gnome, KDE
and Windows. For example, the short-cut to copy the current selection is
Control-C, and to paste the previously copied text the short-cut Control-V can
be used. As another example, the File menu can be accessed by pressing Meta-F.

OPTIONS
=======

Tilde accepts the following options:

*-b*, *--black-white*::
	Force Tilde to use black & white mode. Only attributes such as reverse
	video, underline and bold text will be used to create the interface. This
	option overrides the setting from the configuration file.
*-c*, *--color*::
	Request Tilde to use color mode. This option overrides the setting from the
	configuration file. If the terminal does not support color, or does not
	provide sufficient colors, this option will be ignored.
*-h*, *--help*::
  Display a short help message.
*-I*, *--select-input-method*::
	Ask the user to select the input handling method immediately after start-up,
	as if the user had not previously selected one for the current terminal
	type.
*-T* _terminal_, *--terminal*=_terminal_::
	Set the terminal type to terminal, overriding the TERM environment variable.
*-V*, *--version*::
	Print version and copyright information.
*-x*, *--no-ext-clipboard*::
	Tells Tilde not to attempt to connect to the X11 clipboard.
*-C* _config_, *--config*=_config_::
	Use configuration file _config_ instead of the default configuration file,
	which is typically ~/.config/tilde/config.
*-e* _encoding_, *--encoding*=_encoding_::
	Open any files named on the command line using character encoding
	_encoding_, instead of the default UTF-8 encoding.

To stop Tilde from interpreting file names that start with a dash as options,
one can specify a double dash (--) after which Tilde will interpret any
following arguments as files to read.
