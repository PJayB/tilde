Introduction
============

Tilde is designed to be a text editor for terminals/consoles, which has the
most intuitive UI as possible. Most of the shortcuts you can use in GUI
environments are usable in Tilde as well. That means for example that to copy
selected text, you can press Control-C, and to paste that text you can press
Control-V.

However, being a terminal based programs there are limitations. Not all
terminals provide sufficient information to the client programs to make Tilde
behave in the most intuitive way. When this is the case, Tilde provides
work-arounds which should be easy to work with.


Prerequisites and installation
==============================

Tilde requires a C++ compiler, the libraries of the Tilde Terminal Toolkit
(libt3unicode, libt3window, libt3key and libt3widget), libtranscript and
libconfig (http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/, known as libconfig-hr in
MacPorts/DarwinPorts)

There are two ways in which to compile Tilde:

Using the configure script:
---

$ ./configure
or
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
(see ./configure --help for more tuning options)
$ make all
$ make install
(assumes working install program)

Manually editing the Makefile to suit your computer:
---

$ cp Makefile.in Makefile

Edit the values for the different variables, using the comments in the
Makefile for guidance, to suit your environment.

$ make all
$ make install
(assumes working install program)

The Makefile in the distribution should work on all POSIX compatible make's.
It has been tested using both GNU make and BSD make.


Reporting bugs
==============

If you think you have found a bug, please check that you are using the latest
version of Tilde [http://os.ghalkes.nl/tilde]. When reporting bugs, please
include a minimal example that demonstrates the problem.
