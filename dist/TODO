This file lists the planned but as yet unfinished or unimplemented features for
the Tilde text editor (although some features will necessarily be implemented
in its libraries). The order in which the items appear has no bearing on their
priority.

- Search and replace features:
  - Replace in selection
  - Use of references (\1 .. \9) in regex replace
- Simple syntax highlighting
- Allow users to find out which character(s) is (are) under the cursor
- Auto save and restore on crash
- fmt-like rewrapping of text to a specific width
- X11 integration with the clipboard
- Mouse selection, with X11 PRIMARY integration
- Simple autocompletion based on words found elsewhere in the same document
- Insertion of characters by their Unicode name instead of their codepoint
- Decrease memory usage
- Improve terminal capabilities detection
- Dialogs for changing the settings
- End-of-line type selection and conversion (LF, CR/LF, CR)
- Strip space at end-of-line on save option
- Convert indentation from tabs to spaces and vice-versa

Possible later features, depending on complexity and demand:
- perhaps increase/decrease indentation as appropriate for languages like C,
  where there is a clear rule to do so (opening/closing brace)
- Different kinds of line wrapping
  - break at word (done) or character boundary
  - up/down go to previous/next line instead of stepping within the current
    line (vi style)
- Basic bidi support
