This file lists the planned but as yet unfinished or unimplemented features for
the Tilde text editor (although some features will necessarily be implemented
in its libraries). The order in which the items appear has no bearing on their
priority.

- Search and replace features:
  - Replace in selection
  - Use of references (\1 .. \9) in regex replace
- The cursor should only hit the sides of the screen when it reaches the end
  of the text, not when in the middle of a line. This will give users a clear
  indication of where they are in the text.
- Semi-smart indentation:
  - use same indentation as previous line when the user presses enter
  - perhaps increase/decrease indentation as appropriate for languages like C,
    where there is a clear rule to do so (opening/closing brace)
- Indent/unindent when pressing the tab/shift-tab key and multiple lines are
  selected
- Basic bidi support
- Simple syntax highlighting
- Allow users to find out which character(s) is (are) under the cursor
- Auto save and restore on crash
- Different kinds of line wrapping
  - break at word (done) or character boundary
  - up/down go to previous/next line instead of stepping within the current
    line (vi style)
- fmt-like rewrapping of text to a specific width
- X11 integration with the clipboard
- Simple autocompletion based on words found elsewhere in the same document
- Insertion of characters by their Unicode name instead of their codepoint
- Decrease memory usage
- Improve terminal capabilities detection
- Dialogs for changing the settings
- End-of-line type selection and conversion
- Strip spaces on save option
