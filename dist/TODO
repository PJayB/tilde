This file lists the planned but as yet unfinished or unimplemented features for
the Tilde text editor (although some features will necessarily be implemented
in its libraries). The order in which the items appear has no bearing on their
priority.

- Allow users to find out which character(s) is (are) under the cursor
- Auto save and restore on crash
- fmt-like rewrapping of text to a specific width
- Insertion of characters by their Unicode name instead of their codepoint
- Improve terminal capabilities detection
- Dialogs for changing the settings (partially done)
- End-of-line type selection and conversion (LF, CR/LF, CR)
- Convert indentation from tabs to spaces and vice-versa
- Recognize vi/emacs modelines, and use sensible information (done for
	syntax highlighting)

Possible later features, depending on complexity and demand:
- Increase/decrease indentation as appropriate for languages like C, where
  there is a clear rule to do so (opening/closing brace)
- Matching parenthesis/brace highlighting
- Different kinds of line wrapping
  - break at word [done] or character boundary
  - up/down go to previous/next line instead of stepping within the current
    line (vi style)
- Basic bidi support
