To use ASAN on Tilde, you first need to compile Tilde with the correct flags.
This can be easily accomplished by adding ASAN=1 to the make command line. You
should do this for all its libraries as well.

When compiled in debug mode (which is the only mode in which the ASAN flags
will be passed to the compiler), Tilde normally sets a virtual memory limit to
prevent memory bugs from causing the machine to become unresponsive due to
paging. However, this makes ASAN fail (it hangs the Tilde binary with clang
3.2). To disable the memory limit, add --L -1 to the command line.
