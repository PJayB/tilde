BUGS
====
- select window allows selecting already visible buffer, without properly
	doing a swap. This causes weird behaviour

FILE OPEN
=========
- set dialog starting point to directory of currently open file
- allow encoding selection
- only check for BOM if encoding is UTF-8
- check the order of operations in filebuffer.cc, especially with respect to
	opening the transcript converter
- check that on failure the transcript converter is properly closed

MISSING FUNCTIONALITY
=====================
- file save
- file close with confirmation
- confirmation of file close [for save and for close itself if requested] on
	exit
- recent file tracking (with open recent menu item)
- options setting
- help text
- about dialog


GENERIC
=======
- set name of unbacked files to (Untitled)
- fix of by 1 bug in edit_window.cc
- FIXME's
